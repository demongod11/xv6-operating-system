# Xv6 Operating System

**Enhanced xv6 OS functionality:** Developed system calls to track process metrics, implemented a Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduler with burst time support, and designed test cases to validate scheduler performance against the default Round Robin.

**Optimized memory management:** Implemented lazy memory allocation, kernel processes, and a swapping mechanism with LRU-based page eviction, enabling efficient handling of memory constraints and page faults in xv6.
